# Prime Numbers Table

Ruby coding challenge to produce prime numbers multiplication table.

For example:
ruby prime_table.rb --count 10

Based on https://github.com/karlfreeman/challenges/tree/master/ruby/multi-prime-table.
To more closely fit to the challenge examples, this alternative approach uses OptionParser
to receive arguments and has a different table design output.
